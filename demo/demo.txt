Love it! Works exactly as described.

The phone case fits perfectly and feels sturdy. I’ve dropped my phone twice and it held up great. Only wish it came in more colors.

After trying several brands, this vacuum cleaner is by far the best. It’s quiet, powerful, and easy to clean. The attachments are useful, and the design is sleek. I’ve recommended it to friends and family already!

Terrible quality. Broke after one use.

The charger overheats and stopped working within a week. Very disappointed with this purchase.

I had high hopes for this smartwatch, but it’s been nothing but trouble. The battery drains too fast, the screen freezes often, and syncing with my phone is a nightmare. I contacted support but got no help. Definitely not worth the money.

Dont buy - First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!

Not bad

Works fine. No complaints.

Wow, it only took three hours to figure out how to set it up. Great job on the user manual!

The delivery was late, the box was damaged, and I almost returned it. But surprisingly, the product itself works perfectly.
